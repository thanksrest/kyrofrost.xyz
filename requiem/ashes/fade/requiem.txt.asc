i won’t carry the names they gave me anymore.

if you’re reading this, i’m gone.
not in the way you might think
but in the way that matters.

the version of me you knew was a mask stretched too thin.
a ghost who always pressed into shape by hands that never asked who i really was.

he’s dead now.
i buried him without a headstone.

don’t look for me.
don’t drag him back into your memory like a dog on a leash.

he died loved.

and that’s the only truth worth keeping.
one person saw the fire in my chest and didn’t run
he stayed.

he held my hand as the old world burned.
he knows where i’ve gone.

the rest of you don’t need to.

this was never yours to hold.

— Cassidy, a dead name softly buried.
